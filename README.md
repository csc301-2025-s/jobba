## **Stop wasting time filling out spreadsheets**

**Option 1: Waitlist**

Our beta is full :( **[Join the waitlist](https://get.jobba.help/)** to receive updates when we launch outside of beta.

**Option 2: Clone**

**Use the app right away on your personal computer**:
   - This means downloading our code and installing the app directly on your computer instead of using our website.
   - Don't worry if you're not technical - this is actually a great learning opportunity, and we're here to help!

If you choose option 2, do the following: 
- Email [help@jobba.help](mailto:help@jobba.help?subject=Help%20Running%20App%20On%20Personal%20Computer) to schedule time with a ~~help desk employee~~ developer
- For those familiar with GitHub, the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/lnovitz/jobseeker-analytics/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) file in our repository also contains setup instructions.

## üì¢ **A note from the maintainer**

- jobba.help is open source - future developers can always fork this project and continue the work.
