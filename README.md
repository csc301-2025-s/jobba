## Introduction:
**Overview:**
**Jobba** is a web application that helps users manage their job search by simplifying tasks like tracking applications, networking, and handling email communication. 

**The problem it aims to solve.**
Job searching can be overwhelming, with hundreds of applications to track across spreadsheets, often leading to errors. Jobba simplifies the process by automatically analyzing your Gmail inbox to track job application responses. It creates a **real-time spreadsheet** with key metrics like response rates, helping you refine and optimize your job search strategy.

The key features of the application are as follows:
- Automated Tracking
- User Interface
- Data Export

## Feature Description:
### Automated Tracking:
- **How it works:**  The application connects to your Gmail account to track job applications automatically. Once linked via OAuth, the app scans all your emails for keywords like ‚Äúapplication received‚Äù or ‚Äúinterview scheduled.‚Äù 
- **Real-Time Processing:** The system processes emails quickly and presents the results without requiring manual input.

### User Interface:
- **Light & Dark Mode:** Users can switch between themes for better readability and accessibility.
- **Intuitive Navigation:** The application provides a clear and structured flow:

  - _Gmail Sync Button:_ Initiates the tracking process.
  - _Google Login:_ Users authenticate securely with their Gmail account.
  - _Processing Page:_ Displays progress while scanning emails.
  - _Success Page:_ Confirms completion and provides access to results.
- **GitHub Access:** A direct link to the project‚Äôs GitHub repository is available for users interested in the source code.

### Data Export:
- It compiles the extracted data into a CSV file, providing a structured overview of your job applications.
- **Real-time updates:** The CSV file updates automatically as new relevant emails arrive, ensuring you always have the latest insights.

## How to use Jobba:
- To run this app, click on the following link: [Visit Jobba](https://jobba.onrender.com/)

- If a security warning appears stating that the app is not verified, click **Continue** to proceed.
- If prompted, check the permission box to allow Jobba to access relevant email data.
- After authentication, you will be redirected to a processing page while the application scans your inbox.
